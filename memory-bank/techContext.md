3. **Quality Metrics**: Implement evaluation of retrieval and answer quality
4. **Parameter Tuning**: Systematic optimization of search and chunking parameters
5. **Benchmarking**: Establish quality baselines and improvement targets

### **Infrastructure vs Application Balance**:
- **Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Excellent foundation ready for development
- **Application Logic**: ‚ùå Requires substantial research and development
- **Priority**: Focus entirely on algorithm and prompt improvements
- **Timeline**: Months of development needed before functional system

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technology Reality Check

**Current State**: **EXCELLENT INFRASTRUCTURE, BROKEN APPLICATION**

### **What Technology Delivers**:
- ‚úÖ **Reliable Infrastructure**: Fast, stable, well-organized codebase
- ‚úÖ **Development Framework**: Easy to implement improvements and fixes
- ‚úÖ **Technical Performance**: Efficient processing and resource management
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Clean architecture enabling rapid iteration

### **What Technology Fails To Deliver**:
- ‚ùå **User Value**: Core document QA functionality doesn't work
- ‚ùå **Result Quality**: Poor retrieval and answer generation
- ‚ùå **Business Value**: Technical excellence doesn't translate to user benefit
- ‚ùå **Production Readiness**: Infrastructure ready, application not functional

**Bottom Line**: The technology stack provides an excellent foundation for building a document QA system, but the current application logic and algorithm implementation don't deliver the core value proposition. Substantial research and development work is needed on retrieval quality and prompt engineering before the technical infrastructure can support a functional document QA application.
