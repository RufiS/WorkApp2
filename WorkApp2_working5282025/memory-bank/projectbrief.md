A high-performance, production-grade question-answering application built on Streamlit, FAISS, BM25 and your choice of LLM. It indexes arbitrary text or PDF documents, retrieves relevant chunks, cleans and enriches context, then dispatches to an LLM with retry and error-tracking wrappers. Designed for reliability, transparency and easy extension.
