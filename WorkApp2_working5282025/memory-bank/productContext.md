# Product Context

## Problem Statement
The application addresses the need for a reliable, high-performance question-answering system that can handle arbitrary text or PDF documents. It aims to provide accurate answers by effectively retrieving and processing relevant information from a large corpus of documents.

## How It Should Work
1. **Document Ingestion**: Users can upload text or PDF documents, which are then processed and indexed.
2. **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions, and the system retrieves the most relevant information from the indexed documents.
3. **Context Enrichment**: The retrieved information is cleaned and enriched to improve the quality of the answers.
4. **LLM Integration**: The enriched context is sent to a language model for generating the final answer.
5. **Error Handling**: The system includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure reliability.

## User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- **Speed**: Responses should be generated quickly to maintain user engagement.
- **Accuracy**: Answers should be relevant and accurate to build user trust.
- **Transparency**: Users should be able to understand how answers are generated.
- **Extensibility**: The system should be easy to extend with new features or integrations.
