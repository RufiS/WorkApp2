## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# OR edit config.json
```

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Slow performance**
- Consider GPU acceleration: `pip install faiss-gpu`
- Reduce `top_k` in config.json
- Use smaller documents for testing

**No search results**
- Lower `similarity_threshold` in config.json
- Check if documents processed correctly
- Verify index files in `./data/index/`
