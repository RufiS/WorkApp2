# WorkApp2 Refactoring Progress Log

This document tracks the progress and rationale for each phase of the WorkApp2 refactoring.

## Overview
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-30
- **Goal**: Transform 745-line monolith into modular architecture optimized for rapid development
- **Strategy**: Small increments, comprehensive testing, performance monitoring
- **Constraints**: ≤3 files per PR, ≤500 lines per PR, strict testing requirements

## Refactoring Approach
- **No backward compatibility** - Full modernization for rapid prototype development
- **Safety first** - Comprehensive baseline tests before any changes
- **Performance guarded** - 10% regression threshold with automated monitoring
- **Quality enforced** - Automated code style, type checking, dead code removal

## Architecture Goals
1. **Break monoliths**: Split 745-line workapp3.py and 798-line retrieval_system.py
2. **Improve maintainability**: Focused modules under 600 lines each
3. **Enable parallel development**: Clear separation of concerns
4. **Fix resource issues**: Proper file handling, thread safety, cross-platform paths
5. **Modernize patterns**: Latest Python async, proper error handling, clean interfaces

## Infrastructure Setup
- **Performance baseline**: Automated tracking with `scripts/bench_baseline.py`
- **Size enforcement**: PR limits enforced by `scripts/ci_check_diff_size.sh`
- **Comprehensive testing**: Baseline tests in `tests/legacy/`, smoke tests in `tests/smoke/`
- **Quality gates**: Pre-commit hooks for formatting, type checking, import sorting
- **Safety net**: Git tag `v0.legacy_monolith` for instant rollback

## Phase Log
*(Entries added after each phase completion)*

### Infrastructure Phase (2025-05-30)
**What:** Created comprehensive infrastructure for safe refactoring
**Why:** Ensure refactoring proceeds safely with proper validation and rollback capabilities

**Completed:**
- ✅ Performance baseline tracking system
- ✅ PR size validation scripts  
- ✅ Comprehensive baseline test suite (file upload, vector search, hybrid search, reranking, UI render)
- ✅ Real end-to-end smoke test with TXT file upload → query → answer validation
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for automated quality enforcement
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with all safety constraints
- ✅ Documentation and progress tracking system

**Next:** Begin Phase 1 - Extract UI, document, and query controllers from workapp3.py monolith
