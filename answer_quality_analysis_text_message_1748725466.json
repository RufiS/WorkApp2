The voicemails we \nleave clients may differ slightly depending on the available information we have from the \nclient, but they should generally ﬂow very similarly to this: \n \nStandard VM response to missed call ticket: \n \n \n“Hi there. This is [Name] with the computer repair service you recently reached \nout to, returning your phone call to see if there were any computer difﬁculties we could \nassist you with.

We have the Copyables page in KT3 \nwith pre-written response(s) that can quickly be copied and pasted into our responses. \n \n \n- Generic Email response to emails (to get phone number): \n \n \n \n“Thank you for reaching out to us about your computer issues. We would be happy to \nassist you in getting your issues repaired. \nIs there a phone number and good time we could \ncontact you to discuss getting everything resolved?”\n\n[4] From unknown:\n3rd contact attempt: VM3 > SMS 2 > Close out ticket. \n \n \nText Tickets \n \nFreshdesk ‘New Text Message’ tickets do not provide the information on what number they texted us at \nlike missed call tickets do. You can determine what phone number the EU texted us at by clicking the \ncircled i in RC’s SMS conversation list.. \n \n \nWe now know this client texted into our 678-695-8120 phone number, so we will use that number to call \nthe client back with. We can also assume, but not always guaranteed, that this client is located in Atlanta. \n \nDispatch Queue also receives text messages that clients send to our Field Engineers. Texts sent to our \nField Engineers can be identified by checking the TO: section of the ticket. \n \n \n \nIf the ticket says the text is to ‘Computer Repair’, that means the text message was sent to one of our \nFE’s RingCentral phone numbers. \n \nIf the ticket says the text is to ‘Matthew Karls’. That means the text message was sent to one of our \nDispatch phone numbers.\n\n[5] From unknown:\nemail \n \nMost of your texts will be sent after already leaving a voicemail for a client to have a \nsecondary option for the EU to respond to. \n \n \nGeneral SMS format: \n \n“We tried to return your call for computer repair, but we were unable to reach \nyou. Please call or text us back here to schedule your appointment. Thank you so much \nfor reaching out to us!” \n \n \nAppointment Conﬁrmation (if requested by EU): \n \n“This text is a conﬁrmation of your scheduled computer repair appointment on \n[Date] between [arrival window]. The ﬁeld engineer will contact you roughly 30 minutes \nprior to their arrival. If you need to cancel, please contact us by 8pm the night prior to \nthe appointment to avoid a same-day cancellation fee.
