Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Supervised learning: Training with labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- Neural networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- Deep learning: Neural networks with multiple layers

Vector search is a method used in information retrieval that represents documents and queries as high-dimensional vectors. These vectors capture semantic meaning, allowing for more accurate similarity matching compared to traditional keyword-based search methods.

Applications of machine learning include:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics
- Autonomous vehicles
