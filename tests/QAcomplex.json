    "question": "A brand-new client in ZIP 78054 (outside our normal range) books a same-day 12-3 PM CST visit, then cancels at 10 AM CST the same morning. Calculate every fee we must invoice, listing each line item and the grand total.",
    "answer": "Line-items: $125 same-day cancellation labor (1 hr of TOS) + $4 fuel surcharge + $45 trip fee (non-service ZIP) + $62.50 invoice fee = $236.50 total."
  },
  {
    "question": "A follow-up visit has been rescheduled twice because the original FE called out. The client now asks for any available engineer tomorrow. What dispatcher approval steps are mandatory before assigning a different FE, and why?",
    "answer": "You must obtain explicit confirmation from Helpdesk *or* a manager, because switching engineers on an in-progress follow-up overrides the continuity rule that the original FE owns the job."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain, in exact route-planning terms, why you may never double-stack an 8-10 AM window but can freely double-stack two 9-12 AM windows on the same FE.",
    "answer": "The 8-10 slot is only two hours long; stacking risks missing the hard 10 AM cutoff. All other windows are three hours, giving a one-hour buffer even if the first job runs 2 hrs of TOS."
  },
  {
    "question": "A PST client schedules a 4-7 PM remote support slot. Convert that to the FE's MST calendar and state the latest local time the client can cancel without penalty.",
    "answer": "The FE sees it as 3-6 PM MST (one hour ahead of PST). The client must cancel by 8 PM PST the night before to avoid the Same-Day Cancellation fee."
  },
  {
    "question": "During on-site data recovery an HDD proves unrecoverable. Detail the full cost the client must pay that day if they approve clean-room recovery and live in a trip-fee zone.",
    "answer": "$125 first hour + $4 fuel + $45 trip fee + $250 clean-room deposit = $424 due immediately; lab charges of roughly $750-$1,750 may follow."
  },
  {
    "question": "List every mandatory calendar step to create a reminder for an FE to call a prior client without blocking new bookings.",
    "answer": "Add a two-hour event titled \"Call <Name> <Phone>,\" paste the Slack link or screenshot into WO notes, ensure 'Block Availability' is **not** checked, then ping the FE in #kti."
  },
  {
    "question": "A dispatcher accidentally hits 'Reschedule' on a booked ticket they can't locate. Provide the precise calendar coordinates where the ticket is hiding and the drag-back procedure.",
    "answer": "It's parked in Sunday's 7-8 PM slot. Open that slot, drag the WO back to its correct date/window, and save."
  },
  {
    "question": "After a visit, the EU installs an Office update that breaks Outlook and demands a free revisit. They passed the full 4-Point inspection. Do we oblige? Justify in one sentence.",
    "answer": "No—self-inflicted changes after service void warranty relevance; the next visit is billable unless Helpdesk grants an exception."
  },
  {
    "question": "A new client incurs an unpaid SDC and books again, then no-shows a third time. Explain how invoices stack and whether we still label them 'new'.",
    "answer": "Each missed appointment is added to the same running balance; until they pay any invoice or WO they remain 'new,' so further SDCs keep accruing."
  },
  {
    "question": "Write the one-sentence legal-threat response a dispatcher must give before disconnecting.",
    "answer": "\"I'm sorry, but because you've mentioned legal action I must refer you to our legal team and end this call now.\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Outline the three contact-attempt logging notes and daily frequency limit for clients sitting in the Reschedules list.",
    "answer": "Make at most one attempt per day; note as '1st contact VM/SMS,' '2nd contact VM/SMS,' and '3rd contact VM/SMS—moving to Cancellations' in the ticket description after each try."
  },
  {
    "question": "A client wants to pre-pay by mailed check for a future appointment. Craft a compliant dispatcher reply that still secures the booking.",
    "answer": "Politely decline checks, offer to hold the slot with a prepaid Visa/MasterCard/Discover/Amex gift card, and remind them cards are charged only after service."
  },
  {
    "question": "At what minimum drive-time reduction threshold will dispatch attempt a route optimization swap, and what channel records the proposed changes?",
    "answer": "Managers target swaps saving **more than 10 minutes** of drive time; each proposal is posted in #route-optimization with threaded progress notes."
  },
  {
    "question": "An FE ends a 90-minute job, spends 30 min onsite explaining backup strategies, then another 15 min in the driveway on a client call. How many billable minutes must be recorded and why?",
    "answer": "120 minutes total: the clock starts when the FE steps out of the vehicle and stops when they drive away—post-job explanations count; phone calls offsite don't."
  },
  {
    "question": "List all certifications our Field Engineers hold and the executive who signs their proprietary cert.",
    "answer": "CompTIA A+, assorted Microsoft credentials, and the Karls Technology Field Engineer certification endorsed by CEO Matt Karls."
  },
  {
    "question": "State the dispatcher procedure—step by step—when a client calls to pay an invoice within 24 hours and asks to waive the invoice fee.",
    "answer": "1) Verify name, email, phone, invoice #. 2) Update email if needed. 3) Ping @collections and @managers with details. 4) Note that fee can be dropped because they called within 24 hrs. 5) Tell the client finance will contact them shortly (avoid 'collections' wording)."
  },
  {
    "question": "Compose the exact greeting for answering a live call from the Houston metro line.",
    "answer": "\"Thank you for calling for computer repair. My name is __. How can I help you today?\""
  },
  {
    "question": "Describe the only scenario where a remote appointment is completely free, and name the software involved.",
    "answer": "Transferring an existing N-Able subscription license from one device to another—no other tasks—qualifies for a complimentary remote slot."
  },
  {
    "question": "What explicit note must be added in #appt-reservation if you schedule a 1-3 PM window, and why is that required?",
    "answer": "Add a parenthetical reason, e.g., \"1-3 PM Watkins tomorrow (client flight constraint)\"; non-standard windows demand justification for team visibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "Explain why a client who waived antivirus during the 4-Point inspection but accepted the other three checks loses warranty—include the single permissible override path.",
    "answer": "Declining even one check voids the two-week warranty; only Helpdesk or the original FE can authorize a no-charge revisit despite the waiver."
