Dispatcher Role 
 
 
- The role of a dispatcher is to respond to calls, emails, and appointment requests 
from clients and schedule appointments for Field Engineers. Any missed calls, texts, 
emails, etc all generate a ticket in Freshdesk that dispatchers are responsible for 
responding to as soon as possible. 
 
 
- Dispatchers are the ﬁrst line of communication between the Field Engineers and 
clients and are responsible for informing Field Engineers of any client inquiries. 
 
 
- Overall, Dispatchers handle the phones and scheduling appointments for our 
Field Engineers.

Dispatch Expectations 
 
 
- Dispatch is responsible for scheduling each Field Engineer at least 4 billable 
appointments per work day. 
 
 
- Dispatchers are expected to answer incoming calls and live chats unless already 
on a call or ﬁnalizing a booking, email response, etc. Any missed calls generate a ticket in 
our Freshdesk queue that is to be responded to as soon as possible. 
 
 
- Dispatchers are expected to schedule and develop/optimize routes that are less 
than 2 hours of total drive time per day for each Field Engineer 
 
 
- Dispatchers are expected to submit 40 - 60 logs per work-day averaging 20% - 
30% booking rate.

Chunk 8:
Call Handling 
 
 
- Answering a Live Call 
 
 
When answering a live call, they need to be answered with this introduction: 
 
“Thank you for calling for computer repair. My name is _. How can I help you today?” 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
- - - - - - 
 
- Returning a Phone Call 
 
 
When calling back a client and they answer, we should begin the call with, 
 
“Hi there. This is _ with the computer repair service you reached out to recently, 
returning your phone call to see how we can help.”  
 
If you can tell when the client reached out to us via ticket time-stamp, you can be more 
speciﬁc about when they called. IE - “This is _ with the computer repair service you 
reached out to about 20 minutes ago, returning your phone call…”)

- - - - - - 
 
- Parking a Call 
 
When a client’s needs to be transferred to another person - we can park the call. 
 
 
Parking a call puts the client on hold and provides a 3-digit code that will answer 
the parked call if entered into RingCentral’s Dial-Pad. This 3 digit code is given to whoever 
is intended to speak with the client. When the 3 digit code is called, it will answer the 
parked call. 
 
 
This situation often happens when a Field Engineer is unable to make contact with 
their remote client and requests Dispatch’s assistance making contact. Once the 
Dispatcher has the remote client on the phone, they’ll park the call for the Field Engineer 
to pick up.

- - - - - - 
 
- RingCentral Texting 
Most contact with our clients will take place on the phone and we should always be trying 
to get clients on the phone for the highest probability to book them. 
 
However, there are situations where a text message may need to be sent, such as: 
 
- Sending a text after leaving a voicemail when responding to a ticket 
 
- A client requests a text conﬁrmation about their scheduled appointment 
 
- Client may be deaf or hard of hearing and request to speak through text 
 
- Client states their email is not working to receive our automated conﬁrmation 
Table of Contents

Chunk 11:
email 
 
Most of your texts will be sent after already leaving a voicemail for a client to have a 
secondary option for the EU to respond to. 
 
 
General SMS format: 
 
“We tried to return your call for computer repair, but we were unable to reach 
you. Please call or text us back here to schedule your appointment. Thank you so much 
for reaching out to us!” 
 
 
Appointment Conﬁrmation (if requested by EU): 
 
“This text is a conﬁrmation of your scheduled computer repair appointment on 
[Date] between [arrival window]. The ﬁeld engineer will contact you roughly 30 minutes 
prior to their arrival. If you need to cancel, please contact us by 8pm the night prior to 
the appointment to avoid a same-day cancellation fee. Have a great day!” 
 
Any time we receive a text message, a Freshdesk ticket is generated for it. When replying 
to an SMS/Text message, always ﬁnd the ticket for it that was generated and claim the 
ticket as well as make notes.

Chunk 12:
to an SMS/Text message, always ﬁnd the ticket for it that was generated and claim the 
ticket as well as make notes. 
 
Include the text for the response SMS/Text you sent to the EU as a note in the Freshdesk 
ticket.

- Leaving a Voicemail 
 
 
 
 
Leaving Voicemails is an inevitable part of our job as dispatchers. The voicemails we 
leave clients may differ slightly depending on the available information we have from the 
client, but they should generally ﬂow very similarly to this: 
 
Standard VM response to missed call ticket: 
 
 
“Hi there. This is [Name] with the computer repair service you recently reached 
out to, returning your phone call to see if there were any computer difﬁculties we could 
assist you with. If so, please call us back here at [Metro Phone Number], again that's

assist you with. If so, please call us back here at [Metro Phone Number], again that's 
[Metro Phone Number]. We look forward to hearing from you! Have a great day!” 
 
Standard Appointment Request Response where we know what website they submitted 
the Appointment Request at: 
 
 
 
“Hi there. This is {Name} with Queen Creek Computer Repair Service. I received 
your appointment request regarding difﬁculties with [generalized summary of their 
submitted issue]. We’d be happy to help you with this. Please call us back at [Website 
Phone Number], again that’s [Website Phone Number] to ﬁnish scheduling your

- Informing a Field Engineer to call a client 
 
 
 
 
Clients will often call in wanting to speak with the Field Engineer who assisted 
them on a previous appointment. 
 
 
In these situations, we inform the client that we will pass along their info to the FE 
and that they will reach out as soon as they are available. 
 
1. 
Collect necessary information from the EU as to why they’re wanting to speak with 
the FE so we can provide them context (so they’re not calling their clients blind).  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
1. Ping the FE in main KTI channel with the following information: 
 
 
 
 
A. The client’s name and contact number 
 
 
 
 
B. The reasoning for their calling in 
 
 
 
 
C. The most recent WO ticket link for that EU

Chunk 15:
A. The client’s name and contact number 
 
 
 
 
B. The reasoning for their calling in 
 
 
 
 
C. The most recent WO ticket link for that EU 
 
 
Example: “Hi @FieldEngineer. Previous EU - John Doe 123-456-7890 - called in 
wanting to speak with you about continuing Email issues. Client says they’re not 
receiving their emails after you left and would like to discuss that with you. Please reach 
out when you are available. Previous WO here: 
https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/####### [URL: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/#######] [URL: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/#######].” 
 
2. 
Once your message is posted in the KTI channel, we need to create a reminder 
event on the FE’s schedule. 
 
 
Click and drag a 2-hour window on the FE’s schedule to create an event. Inside the 
Event title, enter “Call [Client’s Name][Phone Number]”. In the event description, include 
your slack conversation from the KTI channel. 
 
 
Example:

Chunk 16:
Event title, enter “Call [Client’s Name][Phone Number]”. In the event description, include 
your slack conversation from the KTI channel. 
 
 
Example:  
 
 
In title: Call John Doe 123-456-7890 
 
 
In Description: Previous EU - John Doe 123-456-7890 - called in wanting to 
speak with you about continuing Email issues. Client says they’re not receiving their 
emails after you left and would like to discuss that with you. Please reach out when you 
are available.  
Previous WO here: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/#######.” 
 
Table of Contents

Chunk 17:
Do NOT check the ‘Block Availability’ box before saving the event - this will cause KT3 to 
think the FE has an additional WO on their schedule, which can cause problems with 
existing WOs. (You can simply un-select (then save again) if you accidentally blocked it) 
 
3.    Lastly, to ensure our Field Engineers are contacting their clients back accordingly, we 
will take a screenshot of the message (Snipping Tool) and/or a direct link to the Slack 
conversation sent to the Field Engineer about the client and paste it into the WO 
associated with the EU. 
 
 
Example: 
Table of Contents

Chunk 18:
Once the copied image is pasted in the EU’s WO notes, you have completed all the steps 
required to properly inform our FE to contact their previous client. From there, FE or 
Helpdesk will inform Dispatch on what to schedule for the EU, whether it be another 
billable service or Revisit.

Chunk 19:
Reserving Appointment Windows: 
 
Once a client has agreed to schedule an appointment with us, inside of the #appt-reservation 
channel, we will post: 
 
1. The Appt Window 
2. The Field Engineer 
3. The Day/Date of the appt 
 
Examples: 
 
8-10 Chase.Barnes tomo 
12-3 Riley.Vargas Friday  
 
In the event that an appointment is being scheduled on a specific date over a week away, we 
can add the specific date to the reservation to avoid confusion. 
 
Example: 
 
12-3 Josh.Watkins, Fri 12/8 
 
Double-stacking Reservation: 
 
- There are times when we are double-stacking windows already scheduled with 
an appointment. In these cases, we want to provide context to our other 
dispatchers to reflect the double-stack. We do this by reserving the OPEN window 
on the FE’s schedule, but noting that it’s actually a double-stack. 
 
In this example, the FE has two 9-12s double-stacked. The reservation would look 
as followed: 
 
2-5 Sam.G tomo (double-stack 9-12, here 1st)

Chunk 20:
In this example, the FE has two 9-12s double-stacked. The reservation would look 
as followed: 
 
2-5 Sam.G tomo (double-stack 9-12, here 1st) 
 
This informs your other dispatchers that you are reserving the only open window 
on the FE’s day, but double-stacking on a different window.

Chunk 21:
Cost of Service 
 
 - As a completely mobile computer repair service, we charge an hourly rate of $125.00 per hour for 
the time the Engineer is on-site. We charge the minimum 1st hour and prorate after that in 15-minute 
increments. This breaks down to $31.25 every 15 minutes AFTER the 1st hour.  We also only accept 
credit/debit cards as a payment method (we are able to accept Mastercard/Visa/Discover/AMEX/Visa Gift 
Cards). 
 
- We also charge a $4 fuel-surcharge which goes directly to the Field Engineer to help off-set rising 
gas prices. 
 
- If an appointment has a Trip-Fee attached, there is an additional $45 charge on top of hourly rate and 
$4 fuel Surcharge. Most appointments will not have a trip fee. 
 
How much for a 1-hour appointment that does not have a trip fee attached? - $129.00 
 
EXAMPLE ON EXPLAINING PRICING TO CLIENTS: 
 
“We charge $125 an hour for the engineer's time and prorate after the first hour; plus a $4 fuel

Chunk 22:
EXAMPLE ON EXPLAINING PRICING TO CLIENTS: 
 
“We charge $125 an hour for the engineer's time and prorate after the first hour; plus a $4 fuel 
surcharge to help the engineers' offset rising gas prices. Typical visits range between 1-2 hours 
and we only accept cards for payment. If any hardware replacements are needed to resolve the 
issue, the engineer will help source out those options for you and determine the best solutions 
for you moving forward.” 
 
If the EU asks for you to explain the hardware situation further - ”We don’t carry 
replacement hardware, so the engineer would have to source out the compatible replacement 
part for your specific device and help you order that. Once we have an idea of when that 
replacement part will arrive, we would set up a 2nd visit to send the engineer back out to help 
with the installation.” 
 
Scheduling Appointments 
 
 
- We have four different windows of arrival that we schedule appointments within for our Field

with the installation.” 
 
Scheduling Appointments 
 
 
- We have four different windows of arrival that we schedule appointments within for our Field 
Engineers. These windows of arrival are: 
 
 
a. 8am - 10am 
 
 
b. 9am - 12pm 
 
 
c. 12pm -3pm 
 
 
d. 2pm - 5pm 
 
 
-Optional Windows of arrival: Optional windows are typically utilized for Revisit appointments 
(non-billable) or used to optimize routes. There are also some Field Engineers who run 5 billable 
appointments per day, which then have an appointment scheduled in the 4-7pm window. 
 
 
e. 10:30am - 1:30pm 
 
 
f. 4pm - 7pm 
 
 
Table of Contents

Chunk 24:
- If you are scheduling an appointment outside of normal arrival windows, a note must be included in the 
#appt-reservation channel as to the reasoning why. An example: “1-3pm Watkins tomorrow. Client is in 
a work meeting until 1pm.” 
 
 
Items to keep in mind when scheduling appointments 
 
 
1. Earliest availability in the schedule 
 
 
2. The Field Engineer’s home location and current route on that day 
 
 
3. Client’s address/location in relation to FE’s route/home 
 
 
- Before confirming an available appointment time with a client, you are required to input the 
client’s provided ZIP or Address into the Field Engineer’s current route on that day to determine if it is a 
suitable appointment to schedule.  
 
General Rule-of-Thumb to follow to ensure scheduling optimal routes for our Engineers: 
 
 
- If the client’s location is LESS than 30 minutes from another appointment, you can offer 
the next immediately available window.

Chunk 25:
- If the client’s location is LESS than 30 minutes from another appointment, you can offer 
the next immediately available window. 
 
 
 
- If the client’s location is GREATER than 30 minutes from another appointment, we 
should offer the 2nd available gap and not schedule the appointments back to back. 
 
 
 
- For example, John has an 8am-10am appointment very close to his home and a client 
that is interested in booking is 40 minutes away from John’s 1st appointment. We should offer this client 
the 12pm-3pm window of arrival since the appointment is GREATER than 30 minutes from John’s 
8am-10am appt. This gives the Dispatch team the opportunity to find another appointment in the 
9pm-12pm window along the way to that 12pm-3pm.

In this example, we can see that the Field Engineer’s first 
appointment, the 8-10 (red square), is within 6am-8am 
(yellow and orange squares) on the schedule. 
 
Since KT3 Calendar is viewed in AZ time, an 8-10am appt 
for EST FE is slotted in the 6-8am time frame on the 
schedule. EST is 2 hours ahead of AZ time. 
 
Same thing with the 2-5pm appointment with the EST FE. It 
shows as 2-5 for the FE (red square), but is slotted in the 
12-3pm window (yellow and orange squares) on our 
Calendar view.

When Can We Call Clients? 
 
We call every metro 7am-9pm UNLESS it's within 15 minutes of when they call or place an appointment 
request and then you can call them at ANYTIME of the day. 
 
Example: If an EST client calls in at 10pm EST (7 or 8pm AZ time), we can still call the EU back even 
though it's past 9pm in their metro (as long as its within 15 minutes of their call)

Follow-Up vs Revisit 
 
A Follow-Up appointment is a BILLABLE service visit, meaning we will charge our hourly rate to send 
the Field Engineer back out to the client for continued service. Follow-Ups are generally for Hardware 
Installations or continuation of a prior visit.  
 
A Revisit appointment is a COMPLIMENTARY service visit equal to the amount of time the Field

Chunk 34:
Installations or continuation of a prior visit.  
 
A Revisit appointment is a COMPLIMENTARY service visit equal to the amount of time the Field 
Engineer was on-site during the prior visit.  
 
- If the Field Engineer was on-site for 1 hour during the first visit, the first hour of the Revisit 
appointment is not charged. Any additional time the FE spends on-site during a Revisit is prorated at the 
normal hourly rate. 
 
- A Revisit appointment requires a FULL 4-Point inspection to be completed during the prior 
service visit for clients to qualify for 2-week Revisit warranty.  
 
Example of a FULL 4-Point Inspection: Client qualifies for Revisit

Chunk 35:
Example of a Waived 4-Point Inspection: Client does NOT qualify for Revisit

- If even 1 of the 4 points are waived, the client is waiving their right to a 2-week Revisit warranty 
period with us.

Chunk 37:
Collecting Client Information 
 
 
Once a client agrees to schedule in an available window, we must collect the necessary information from 
the client for the booking. 
 
KT3’s Dispatch Page has the following sections required to be filled out for every Work Order: 
 
Name: Client’s First and Last name with proper punctuation 
Phone: Best Contact Number to reach EU 
Email: Email Address to send confirmation email 
Street: Home or Business Address we’re sending the FE to 
Notes: Any additional notes required to access a client’s location or that FE should be aware of: Gate 
Codes, Enter through garage, wear PPE, ETC. 
Referrer: Where the client found/heard about us, typically Google. 
Summary of Work: Quick summary of the issues the FE will be handling 
Description: Details what issues the client is having and what they are wanting done during the visit.

3 key details to gather on every booking call for the Field Engineer 
 
 
 
1. Windows or Apple? (EUs may not know which specific OS they are running, so simply knowing 
its a Windows or Apple device is sufficient in most situations) 
 
2. Laptop, Desktop, Tablet? (Specify what device(s) the FE will be working on) 
 
3. Estimated of Age of Device

Booking Call Check-List 
 
During every booking call, we MUST inform clients of these items: 
 
1. Cost of Service 
 
- We charge $125 per hour for the time the Engineer spends on-site. 
 
- Minimum charge of 1st hour ($125), prorated after the first hour in 15 minute increments.

Chunk 39:
1. Cost of Service 
 
- We charge $125 per hour for the time the Engineer spends on-site. 
 
- Minimum charge of 1st hour ($125), prorated after the first hour in 15 minute increments. 
($31.25 every 15 minutes after the 1st hour) 
 
- $4 Fuel Surcharge to offset gas prices for FEs 
 
- $45 Trip Fee if applicable (Trip Fees) 
 
2. 4-Point Inspection 
 
- FEs perform a 4-Point inspection to ensure the health of our client’s systems. 
 
 
- If clients ask to know what that is, you can inform them that “our 4-Point inspection is an 
industry-standard health check for your system to verify the health of it and ensure that your information is not only 
secured, but backed-up entirely in the event of any system failure.” 
 
 
- Provides a 2-week warranty period to any system issues related to the previous visit. Contact 
must be received within 2-weeks of the warranty period to qualify (In situations where the client did attempt

Chunk 40:
must be received within 2-weeks of the warranty period to qualify (In situations where the client did attempt 
contact to us within 2-weeks and we simply missed the window by the time contact was returned, we can still set up 
the Revisit.) 
 
3. Cancellation Policy 
 
- Clients must notify us of any need to cancel or reschedule their appointment by 8pm (in the 
EU’s relative time-zone) the night prior to the appointment to avoid a same-day cancellation fee. 
 
 
- The SDC fee is waived if a client reschedules their appointment to another day. Once that 
rescheduled appointment is completed, the square invoice is canceled out/waived. 
 
Confirm Appointment Time 
 
- Once all information is gathered to schedule the appointment, confirm the appointment date 
and time with the client to ensure there is no confusion. 
 
 
Example - “I have all of the information I need on my end. I have your appointment scheduled on Friday,

and time with the client to ensure there is no confusion. 
 
 
Example - “I have all of the information I need on my end. I have your appointment scheduled on Friday, 
December 13th, with an arrival window between 12-3pm. Our field engineer will contact you roughly 30 
minutes prior to their arrival to let you know they’re on their way over.”

BOOKING CALL EXAMPLE: Use this as a reference (this call is about how 90% of my booking 
calls go with an average 30-40% booking rate)

"Thank you for calling for computer repair! My name is Sam. How can I help you today?" 
 
- Hi Dan. I'm having trouble with my computer not turning on. It was working fine yesterday, but now when I tried 
pressing the 'on' button, nothing happens.

[Looking at schedule, plugging in zip to routes, finding earliest opening] 
 
"Since we're a mobile computer repair service, we charge for the time that our engineer spends on-site with you at an 
hourly rate of $125.00/hour, prorated after the first hour. Typical service visits range anywhere between 1-2 hours, but 
it ultimately depends on what the Engineer determines once he has a chance to diagnose your system(s). There's 
also a $4 fuel surcharge to help offset gas costs for the engineer and we only accept credit card for payment." 
 
[If client remains on the call] 
 
"Give me just a quick moment to check our availability." 
 
"At this time, Our earliest availability is Friday, the 21st, between 12-3pm as the arrival window. " 
 
- So, it starts at 12 or they can arrive anywhere within that window? 
 
"It is an arrival window, but the Field Engineer will contact you roughly 30 minutes prior to their arrival." 
 
- Okay, I'll take it.

Table of Contents

Chunk 45:
"Great. The address we'll be sending our Engineer to?" 
 
- 1234 Alphabet Street, Google, 00000 
 
"Any Unit numbers or Gate Codes?" 
 
- No. Its a house. 
 
“How did you hear about us? Was it a Yahoo search, Google, Bing” 
 
- Bing 
 
"Thanks, John. Regarding your computer experiencing the booting issues. Is this a Laptop or Desktop?" 
 
- Laptop. 
 
"Okay. Is it a Windows or Apple laptop?" 
 
- Its not Apple. I hate them 
 
"Okay. Do you know if it's running Windows 10?" 
 
- I think so. 
 
"Roughly how old is your computer?" 
 
- A few years I think. 
 
"Perfect. Besides the booting difficulties, is there anything else you'd like the engineer to take a look at while he's 
on-site? Any other devices you're having issues with?" 
 
- No. Just the laptop. I use it for work.

[Closing the call - confirming appointment time, 4-Point inspection, and cancellation policy] 
 
"Sounds good. Well, John, I have all of the information that I need on my end. Just to confirm your appointment time, 
real quick. I have your appointment set for Friday, the 21st, with an arrival window between 12-3pm.  
 
Our Engineer will contact you roughly 30 minutes prior to their arrival to give you a heads up they're on the way over.  
 
Once the Engineer has resolved your system's issues, we perform a 4-Point health inspection to make sure your 
system is looking healthy, and it also provides a 2-week warranty period with us. So if your system experiences 
issues related to the visit, we'll send our engineer back out for a complimentary visit, equal to the time they were 
on-site before.

Chunk 47:

Lastly, we do have a same-day cancellation policy. So, if something comes up and you need to reschedule or cancel 
your appointment, please make sure to do so by contacting us here by 8pm the night prior to the appointment to 
avoid a cancellation fee." 
 
"You're all set. We're there any other questions I could help you with today?" 
 
- No. Looking forward to Saturday. Thanks.

Logging Calls 
 
Every time you make or take a call, there should be a log submitted.  
 
We have 13 different call log scenarios available to use:

9. No Book / Too Far Out 
 
- When a client mentions our soonest availability is too far in the future for them and they need 
something sooner. 
 
- When a client is located in a metro where we currently do not have an active Field Engineer, so 
we cannot schedule an on-site visit (Need to make sure remote-option is offered)

Chunk 51:

-”I’m not ready to schedule anything yet. I’d like to call around a bit first.” 
 
11. Sent Text Message 
 
- When we send a SMS response to a client 
 
12. SPAM 
 
- Robo-Callers 
 
- Ghosts (No response on the other line when we answer a phone call) 
 
13. Wrong Company (see notes) 
 
- When a client meant to call a different company, usually the Geek Squad 
 
- “Oh, I thought this was the Geek Squad?” 
 
 
- *TIP* In these cases, I like to let the client know, “If Geek Squad is not able to help you 
in a timely manner, please call us back as we are happy to help”) 
 
Oftentimes, Geek Squad will send a client’s PC to a 3rd party for the repair and can take multiple weeks 
for the system to be repaired. So, clients who can’t wait that long will still call us to help them, regardless 
if they have a ‘contract’ with the Geek Squad.

4 items to include when logging a TFO: 
 
- Zip Code [Needs to also be included in the ‘information about call’ section] 
- Quick summary about the client’s computer issues 
- The date offered that was too far out for EU and date wanted

Ticket Handling 
 
Key Points: 
 
 
- Tickets are always given 3 contact attempts prior to closing them out. 
 
 
 
- Tickets must be claimed prior to working on it. To avoid having multiple 
dispatchers attempting to contact the same client. 
 
 
 
- Prior to closing any ticket, check if there are any mergeable tickets in the queue 
for the client that we can also close out 
. 
 
 
- NEVER MARK A TICKET AS SPAM. It breaks things in Freshdesk, so do not click 
the Spam button. EVER… please. 
 
 
 
- Typically minimum 30 minutes between contact attempts unless an EU tries to 
reach us back before then. 
 
 
Proper 3 touches on each ticket type:

Text Tickets 
 
Freshdesk ‘New Text Message’ tickets do not provide the information on what number they texted us at 
like missed call tickets do. You can determine what phone number the EU texted us at by clicking the 
circled i in RC’s SMS conversation list.. 
 
 
We now know this client texted into our 678-695-8120 phone number, so we will use that number to call 
the client back with. We can also assume, but not always guaranteed, that this client is located in Atlanta. 
 
Dispatch Queue also receives text messages that clients send to our Field Engineers. Texts sent to our 
Field Engineers can be identified by checking the TO: section of the ticket. 
 
 
 
If the ticket says the text is to ‘Computer Repair’, that means the text message was sent to one of our 
FE’s RingCentral phone numbers. 
 
If the ticket says the text is to ‘Matthew Karls’. That means the text message was sent to one of our 
Dispatch phone numbers.

Chunk 59:

Chunk 60:
When we receive a text message that is intended for an FE, we need to look up the phone number that 
texted the FE, find the client’s info and which FE they are currently scheduled with, then send a message 
to the FE in the KTI channel that their client is messaging them. 
Example: @Fieldengineer Your client - Jane Doe 123-456-7890 - is texting you

- Email Response 
 
- Responding to Emails should be a fairly quick process. We have the Copyables page in KT3 
with pre-written response(s) that can quickly be copied and pasted into our responses. 
 
 
- Generic Email response to emails (to get phone number): 
 
 
 
“Thank you for reaching out to us about your computer issues. We would be happy to 
assist you in getting your issues repaired. 
Is there a phone number and good time we could 
contact you to discuss getting everything resolved?”

Chunk 61:
assist you in getting your issues repaired. 
Is there a phone number and good time we could 
contact you to discuss getting everything resolved?” 
 
 
- If the EU’s email provides some specific issues about their computer’s troubles, we’d like to 
personalize the email to better inform the client we understand what they’re having trouble with. 
Example: if a client emails in that their computer’s screen isn’t displaying anything: 
 
 
 
“Thank you for reaching out to us about your computer screen’s display issues. We 
would be happy to assist you in getting your issues repaired. Is there a phone number and good time we 
could contact you to discuss getting everything resolved?” 
 
 
- If a client is requesting a price quote over email: 
 
 
“Thank you for reaching out to us about your computer issues. We would be happy to 
assist you in getting your issues repaired. Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine an accurate price

Chunk 62:
“Thank you for reaching out to us about your computer issues. We would be happy to

- Appointment Request 
 
When a client submits an appointment request online, it shows up as a ticket in our queue for us to call 
back asap. They are the highest booking conversion tickets, so it is expected that these are handled right 
away. 
 
Appointment Requests provide us a ton of information right away, including the client’s: 
Name, Phone number, Email address, Zip Code, and the Computer Issues they’re experiencing.

Chunk 63:
away. 
 
Appointment Requests provide us a ton of information right away, including the client’s: 
Name, Phone number, Email address, Zip Code, and the Computer Issues they’re experiencing. 
 
In this example [URL: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/1540507], we see Jerry Hogan submitted an appointment request to Scottsdale Computer Repair 
Service because their system ‘Crashed’ and they live in 85268. 
 
 
We already have a ton of the information we need to book an appointment, which makes booking these 
tickets very simple.

Chunk 64:
Step-by-Step on how to handle Appointment Requests: 
 
 
1. Claim the ticket by adding a private note which says: Calling - [Dispatcher Name] 
 
2. Refresh the page to ensure you are the only Dispatcher who claimed the ticket. If another 
dispatcher’s ‘claim’ shows up prior to yours, delete your note and move on to the next ticket. 
 
3. Determine which website the EU used to submit the appointment request by locating the URL 
at the top of the request. Example image included:

their appointment request through, so we want to call back the client using the phone number on the 
website, which is 480-240-2960.You can click the link in the appt request to open up the website to find 
the phone number.Clients are most likely to answer a phone call from a number they just recently viewed.

Using the same example from before, “Hi Jerry. This is _ from Scottsdale Computer Repair Service. I 
received your appointment request here regarding your computer system crashing?” 
 
From there, the call should be just like any booking call. Once the client is scheduled, add a private note 
to the appointment request that the EU was booked and close out the ticket. 
 
 
4b. If the client does NOT answer, we should leave a voicemail like so: 
 
“Hi Jerry. This is Sam with Scottsdale Computer Repair Service. I received your appointment 
request here regarding your computer system crashing and wanted to finish setting up the 
appointment to help you with that. Please call us back here at 480-240-2960 to finish scheduling

their email address. Using the Copyables response for Appointment Requests, we can quickly respond to 
them.

- Spam Tickets 
 
- We NEVER mark a ticket as Spam. It breaks the back-end Freshdesk filtering, so anytime a 
Spam ticket enters the queue, we simply close it out. 
 
Example(s) of a Spam ticket:  
 
 
 
 
If you’re uncertain about whether a ticket is Spam or not, just LEAVE it. One of the dispatch managers 
will review to close out the spam ticket.

Merging Tickets: 
 
Generally, ticket merges will happen automatically with Freshdesk’s API integration. However, there are 
times when multiple tickets will need to be merged together. 
In the example, we can see there are two separate tickets with the phone number: (602) 783-8116 
 
We will merge these tickets by checking the box on the left hand side of the ticket to select them and then 
click on the ‘Merge’ button at the top of Freshdesk 
 
 
 
From there, a sidebar will popup for confirmation on the merge. 
 
 
The blue check on the right hand side indicates which ticket is going to be the Primary ticket that the other 
is merged into. Generally, the most recent ticket from the EU should be the primary. 
 
Once you have confirmed both of the tickets are the same number/client - click the Blue ‘Continue’ button, 
then ‘Merge’  at the bottom of the sidebar. 
 
You have successfully merged two tickets together.

Miscellaneous Ticket Types: 
 
 
- Alert: Pro AV (Full Monitoring): 
 
 
These tickets stem from clients that use our N-able Antivirus software. This ticket 
is a report/alert from the client’s system that something needs to be checked out. This issue 
could be HDD failure, Storage Capacity issues, Disk Usage problems, etc. 
 
Example ticket: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/1599509 [URL: https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/1599509] 
 
In the example ticket, we can see the client’s name is Michael Feeder: Device: Michael Feeder 
| Surface | Home 
 
We can see the ‘metric that triggered the notification’ being a ‘disk usage’ trigger. 
 
So, we would want to find the client’s contact information via their name, reach out to the client 
and inform them that we received a notice that their system’s disk usage is reaching near 
maximum capacity and that they should have one of our Engineers out to take a look.

We received a notice about your system through our N-Able antivirus software that your system 
is reaching near maximum disk usage capacity, which is now being reported as a ‘Warning’

Rescheduling Clients 
- Due to FE callouts 
 
When FEs call out, Dispatch must contact that FE’s clients and inform them that we need to 
reschedule. 
 
 
Calls to clients should be relatively simple and can sound very similar to this, “We are sorry for 
the inconvenience, but your Field Service Engineer will not be able to make it out into the field 
today, so we are trying to reschedule your appointment to the next soonest availability.” 
 
 
If the client agrees to reschedule, find the soonest opening and start offering those spots until 
you find one that works for the EU. 
 
 
If the client does not agree to reschedule and decides to cancel the appointment, we make 
a note of that to mark the number of cancellations on the FE’s day for calling out. 
 
 
Example Voicemail:

Chunk 78:

today, so we are trying to reschedule your appointment to the next soonest availability. Please call us 
back here at [Local Metro Number] to reschedule your appointment. Have a good day.” 
 
 
After a voicemail is left, we follow up with a text using the Copyables: SMS for FE call out 
(after leaving VM saying the same message):  
 
“We are sorry for the inconvenience, your Field Service Engineer will not be able to make it out into the 
field today, so we are trying to reschedule your appointment to the next earliest availability. Please call or 
text us back at this number to reschedule your appointment.” 
 
 
- EU requesting reschedule 
 
If the clients appointment is not on the same-day they’re calling in to reschedule, move the 
currently scheduled appointment to the agreed upon reschedule date. 
 
- EU is on Reschedule List

Chunk 80:
If the clients appointment is not on the same-day they’re calling in to reschedule, move the 
currently scheduled appointment to the agreed upon reschedule date. 
 
- EU is on Reschedule List 
 
When clients are placed on the reschedule list, we will call these clients to try and get them back 
on the schedule asap to fill gaps. 
 
 
If you are designated to contact clients in our list of reschedules, this is how to approach the call. 
 
 
Example Voicemail: 
 
 “Hi there, this is [Name] with Karls Technology Computer Repair Service. We have your appointment in 
our list of Reschedules regarding [brief description of the noted PC issues client is having]. We are 
looking to reschedule your appointment to our next soonest opening. Please call us here at [local metro 
number] so that we may reschedule your appointment. Have a great day!” 
 
 
Follow up the VM with a Text which can be similar to the voicemail you left.

Chunk 81:

Follow up the VM with a Text which can be similar to the voicemail you left. 
 
A note for each reschedule attempt needs to be left in the calendar description.   
 
Appointments will receive 3 touches before being moved to cancellations.   
 
Any touches resulting in a cancellation should be logged at “Called for Cancellation” 
 
Any cancellations should be posted to #comms 
 
- EU was an SDC 
 
 
If a client is calling in to reschedule their appointment that was previously an SDC: 
 
 
- Leave the original SDC appointment on the FE’s calendar 
 
 
- Develop a new WO for the client. 
 
 
- Use the same information that was in the previous WO (including any additional items if 
EU requests), then schedule the appointment at the agreed upon date/time 
 
 
- Once the new appt is on the schedule, mark the title with *Notes*[Client Name], then

How to Contact Clients in our Reschedules 
 
When designated to handle contacting clients in our list of Reschedules, navigate to the Dispatcher tab in 
KT3 and click the drop-down, then click TFOs/Reschedules. 
https://app.karlstechnology.com/dispatch/tfos [URL: https://app.karlstechnology.com/dispatch/tfos] 
 
Once there, on the right hand side of the page, click on the Reschedules tab to open up the list of 
Reschedules we have on our calendar. 
 
You will notice that at the top of the page, there is a ‘Region Select’ dropdown that will filter the 
Reschedules per metro you are focused on. 
 
On the right hand side, clicking the blue Calendar button 
 will open up a new KT3 with that specific 
WO opened. 
 
 
Filter the Reschedules page to your metro(s) that you are designated and work from the top-down. After 
each contact attempt, you will add a note in the ticket description noting the contact attempt. Similarly to

Chunk 85:
each contact attempt, you will add a note in the ticket description noting the contact attempt. Similarly to 
tickets, Clients are given three contact attempts before their Reschedule appointment is moved to 
cancellations. 
 
Example of how you should note your contact attempt: 
 
*3rd Contact attempt to Reschedule, VM/SMS. Moving to Cancellations* - Dispatcher 
[date] 
*2nd Contact attempt to Reschedule, VM/SMS* - Dispatcher [date] 
*1st Contact attempt to Reschedule, VM/SMS* - Dispatcher [date] 
 
We should only contact a client in Reschedules once per day. So, if you see a note that the client has 
already been contacted today, move on to the next EU on the list.

Chunk 86:
Example of how to open on these calls: 
 
“Hello [EU]. This is [Dispatcher Name] with Karls Technology Computer Repair Service. I’m reaching out 
to reschedule your appointment to assist with your [brief summary of EU’s system issues]. Are you 
available to reschedule your appointment at this time?” 
 
If a client indicates they do not wish to reschedule but would prefer to cancel the appointment entirely, or 
if this is the third reschedule attempt  check the ‘Cancelled’ button and then ‘Update Ticket’ 
 
Log the call as a Cancellation, post the cancellation in comms, then move on to the next client.

Optimizing Routes 
 
Why do we optimize routes?  
 
We optimize routes for our Field Engineers because we want to reduce the total time they have to 
drive between appointments. The goal is to keep all Field Engineers’ drive times below 2 hours. 
 
Double Stacking appointments 
 
A Field Engineer’s schedule can oftentimes be optimized by moving a single appointment on their 
schedule into a different 3 hour window of arrival. Since our windows of arrival are 3 hours (except for 
8-10s), we only need a single client to agree to shift their appointment time, as opposed to relying on two 
clients to agree on swapping their appointment windows. We do not stack 8-10s, only 3-hour windows. 
 
Here is an example of double-stacking appointments:  
 
The first image shows one of our Field Engineers with a full schedule. 
However, when we open up the FE’s route on the day, we can see that in

Chunk 89:
This non-optimized route is 2 hours and 17 minutes of drive time (with Tolls 
unselected) for the Engineer. 
 
However, we can also see that the 9-12 (2nd) and 2-5 (EOD) appointments 
are very close to one another, so we need to find a way to have the FE hit 
both of those appointments back to back to avoid zig-zagging. So, we 
contact the 2-5 appointment (Robert Droege) to see if he is potentially 
available earlier in the day, either 9-12 or 12-3. Whether EU moves up to 
9-12 or 12-3, either 3 hour window can be double-stacked and have the FE hit the appointments in 
optimal order. 
 
In this case, Robert Droege was contacted and agreed to move up to 12-3pm and was double-stacked 
with Walter Bajkowski. Now, we can see that this Field Engineer has two 12-3 appointments on their 
schedule. The appointment we want the Engineer to hit last has been shifted down by a half-hour to 
reflect which appointments the Engineer should go to first. This FE’s route has now been optimized.

Won’t double-stacking appointments cause the FE to be late to the second of the stacked 
appointments? 
 
- Not necessarily. Field Engineers’ aim to hit at least 1.5-2 hours of TOS per service visit. This 
Table of Contents

Chunk 92:
doesn’t happen nearly enough, but for the sake of this example, let’s say our FE gets that TOS on all 4 of 
their appointments, but they have two double-stacked 9-12s and a 12-3 as their EOD. The FE should 
arrive at their first appointment right around 8am, then arrive at their first 9-12 around 10am, then to their 
second 9-12 closer to the end of the window, around noon. Of course, delays do happen, and it's up to 
the FE at that point to inform their clients of any delays. (If an FE is unable to contact their client, then 
dispatch can step in to attempt contact to inform). 
 
Can I double-stack an appointment window that is already filled if it makes sense on the route? 
 
- You are encouraged to schedule an appointment and double-stack an already filled 
window if it makes sense for the route. It makes more sense to try and double-stack for a more optimal 
route than to fill a nonoptimal gap on the schedule. Plus, it is likely we’ll end up having to call the client

Chunk 93:
route than to fill a nonoptimal gap on the schedule. Plus, it is likely we’ll end up having to call the client 
anyways to attempt to shift them around. Currently, KT3’s FE Availability tool does NOT have a method to 
show available double-stacks, so you have to insert the clients zip/address to their routes to confirm. (This 
should already be being done anyways). 
 
How do we optimize routes? 
 
- Each day, sometimes multiple times per day, one of the dispatch managers will review the 
following day’s schedule to determine any swaps that can be made to optimize any FE’s route. These 
swaps are then posted to the #route-optimization channel and individual dispatchers will be designated to 
handle the optimizations, typically on a per metro basis. 
 
 
- Typically, optimizations are only attempted if the swap will reduce total drive time greater than 
10 minutes. If a route optimization is only going to reduce drive time by 5 minutes, we would prefer to

Chunk 94:
10 minutes. If a route optimization is only going to reduce drive time by 5 minutes, we would prefer to 
keep a client in their originally scheduled window to prevent potential conflicts if we ask them to change. 
 
Example of how a route optimization looks: 
 
 
This example shows Dispatch Team Lead, Sam, discussing what optimizations need to be attempted for 
each Field Engineer in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro. 
 
Once the optimizations are posted, individual dispatchers will be designated to handle a metro’s 
optimizations. 
 
 
When you are designated to handle optimizations, inside the same message where you are designated, 
create a thread and copy-paste the optimizations in the thread and make notes on whether a client

Moving Clients Forward To Fill Gaps 
 
There are times when a Field Engineer(s) does not have 4 billable appointments scheduled. Field 
Engineers are required to run 4 billable service visits a day unless approved otherwise by Helpdesk or 
Management.  
 
These gaps can occur from numerous reasons such as: Same-Day Cancellations, Client rescheduling 
their appointments the night prior, FE needing an additional appointment due to low TOS on their other 
appointments, etc. 
 
Dispatchers should recognize a gap in a Field Engineers schedule and look to fill it as soon as possible. 
 
Oftentimes, Management will designate an individual dispatcher to find a fill for an engineer. These are 
the steps the dispatcher should take to most efficiently find a fill.

Chunk 97:
Oftentimes, Management will designate an individual dispatcher to find a fill for an engineer. These are 
the steps the dispatcher should take to most efficiently find a fill. 
 
 
1. Check the TFOs/Reschedules page in KT3 under the Dispatch Drop-down and look for any 
TFOs from the last day or two in the Metro to contact. A Zip Code should be included in the TFO, so 
check to make sure it fits in the FE’s current route on the day before reaching out. 
 
 
 
 
2. If there are no more TFOs available for contact, check the Reschedules available in the 
area and reach out to them. Reschedules are located on Sundays between 7-8pm window. Again, check 
to make sure it fits in the FE’s current route on the day before reaching out. 
 
 
3. If TFOs and Reschedules do not work out, look forward on the schedule for the latest 
scheduled appointment (Safe bet is to check atleast 1 week ahead from current date) and start contacting

Chunk 98:
3. If TFOs and Reschedules do not work out, look forward on the schedule for the latest 
scheduled appointment (Safe bet is to check atleast 1 week ahead from current date) and start contacting 
the clients that fit best moving backwards towards today. We want to try and avoid moving a client forward 
from the next day if possible because we create another gap that needs to be filled. Obviously, filling a 
same-day gap is more important than a next-day gap. 
 
 
The process we should take to move a client 
forward:  
A. Open up the FE’s current route that you’re trying to fill in 
Google Maps. 
B. Open the ‘Optimize Route’ page in a new window. (right

Acceptable Forms of Payment 
 
We accept CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS and GIFT CARDS issued by Mastercard/Visa/Amex/Etc 
for payment. We do NOT accept Cash or Checks. 
 
- Clients are expected to pay the Field Engineer at the conclusion of each service visit for their TOS. 
However, some clients are unable to pay when expected, so they are then sent an invoice for the TOS + a 
$62.50 invoice fee 
 
- If a client calls in within 24 hours of receiving an invoice for service, we can drop the $62.50 invoice fee 
prior to collecting the payment.

Client Calling in to Pay an Invoice 
 
- When a client calls in to pay an outstanding invoice, we must forward that call to our Payments team 
or a Manager for them to collect the payment so they can automatically update their backend 
documentation which tracks these invoices. 
 
- The proper way to inform the Payments team about a client’s call in: 
 
1. Collect client name, phone number, email address and invoice # if the client has it available 
 
2. Verify the client’s email address that they received the invoice at and confirm it matches in our 
system. If not, update it.

Chunk 103:
2. Verify the client’s email address that they received the invoice at and confirm it matches in our 
system. If not, update it. 
  
3. In Dispatchers channel, ping @collections and @managers with the above information 
 
4. Inform the client that the financials team has been informed and they will reach out to collect 
payment as soon as possible. 
 
Example: @collections @managers John Doe, (johndoe123@gmail.com [URL: mailto:johndoe123@gmail.com], 123-456-7890) called in to pay 
invoice #123456. Client was informed one of you will reach out when available. 
 
- Client calling in to pay N-able invoice? Refer to the N-able section. 
 
*Important* We want to avoid telling clients that we’ve sent their info to our collections team as it 
may cause confusion and lead the EU to believe their invoice was sent to collections. We simply 
want to let them know we’ve passed on the information to the correct team and that it will be handled 
accordingly.

Appointment Cancellations 
 
Once an appointment is booked, the client is automatically emailed a copy of our cancellation 
policy in detail. 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
Appointment Cancellation Policy Agreement: 
 
Karls Technology is committed to providing all of our clients with exceptional care. When a client 
cancels without giving enough notice, they prevent another client from being serviced. When you 
scheduled your appointment understand that you are holding a reservation time for service. Please 
notify us before the end of the business day prior to your scheduled appointment to notify us of any 
changes or cancellations. If prior notiﬁcation is not given, you will be charged an hour of billable service 
for the missed appointment reservation.

When a client requests to cancel their appointment with us, we must first ask the client if they 
are requesting to reschedule instead of fully canceling their appointment. Typically, clients will 
take the opportunity to be moved to reschedules to avoid having to go through the booking 
process again when their schedule opens up. Moving an appointment to reschedules also 
allows KT3 software to automatically send the client *reminder* emails that they have an 
appointment they need to reschedule. 
 
Same-Day Cancellations 
 
Per our Appointment Cancellation Policy Agreement “If prior notification is not given, you 
will be charged an hour of billable service for the missed appointment reservation.” 
 
When a new client same-day cancels or reschedules their appointment, they receive an invoice

Chunk 107:
will be charged an hour of billable service for the missed appointment reservation.” 
 
When a new client same-day cancels or reschedules their appointment, they receive an invoice 
equal to 1 hour of TOS ($125) + $4 Fuel Surcharge + $62.50 invoice fee, totalling $191.50. 
 
Same-Day Cancellation Fees are ONLY sent to NEW clients. 
  
We do NOT send SDC fees to EXISTING clients. 
 
Same-day bookings ALSO receive an SDC fee if the client calls back in to cancel. 
 
We need to be sure we properly inform clients that do schedule a same-day appointment about 
our cancellation policy. This is an example of how I like to inform client: 
 
“Typically, we require 24 hours notice of any need to cancel or reschedule to avoid a 
cancellation fee. Since this is a same-day booking, you are waiving that option and if you 
Table of Contents

Chunk 108:
cancel the appointment, there would be a fee associated with that. However, if you do 
need to cancel the appointment, as long as you reschedule the appointment, any 
cancellation fee is waived.” 
 
*Important* - Dispatchers who handle the call where a client is canceling or rescheduling a 
same-day appointment MUST immediately look for a replacement appointment as well as 
notify the #Dispatchers channel about the opening on the FE’s schedule, and the FE in 
the #kti channel. This will allow the entirety of the dispatch team to be aware of the gap and 
potentially fill it with an EU they spoke with earlier.

- Clients may call in on the same-day of their appointment to reschedule to another date. 
 
- In these situations, the client STILL receives a SDC fee, but it will be waived upon completion of the 
rescheduled appointment. 
 
- How to handle same-day reschedule situations: 
 
 
1. Mark today’s appointment as an SDC and leave it on the FE’s schedule so they know 
to send the fee. Ping the FE in the KTI channel to inform them to send a fee. 
 
 
 
2. Using all of the same information, develop a new WO for the EU and schedule it at the 
agreed upon reschedule date 
 
 
 
3. Once the rescheduled appointment is on the calendar, add *Notes* before the client’s 
name in the title and then add a reminder about the SDC in the ticket description, *EU has SDC fee from 
[date]. Cancel out once service is completed.* 
 
If the clients is interested in rescheduling, but they do not yet know when they’ll be available:

Chunk 110:
[date]. Cancel out once service is completed.* 
 
If the clients is interested in rescheduling, but they do not yet know when they’ll be available: 
 
- Follow the same steps of recreating the WO, but simply move it to Reschedules List by checking 
the ‘Needs Rescheduled’ box so that it automatically sends EU reminders to reschedule their appt. 
 
You have now completed a same-day reschedule.

New versus Existing Client 
 
A client is considered EXISTING once we have received payment for a service visit from them. 
This also includes the client having paid in full, any fee incurred due to a Same Day 
Cancellation. 
 
Client’s are also labeled Existing or New on a Field Engineer’s schedule:

Black-Listed Clients 
 
A ‘Black Listed’ client is a client that one of our Field Engineers has requested to no longer work 
with for [insert reason]. Generally, clients are blacklisted for: Hazardous working environments 
or if they were extremely rude to the FE or any employee at our company. 
 
A Black Listed client will be labeled as such in the ‘Notes’ section of their profile:

Chunk 112:
Four-Point Inspection 
 
- A FULL 4-Point inspection is required during a service visit to provide a client a 2-week Warranty period 
with us. If even 1 of the 4 points of inspection are declined, they waive their right to any warranty with us 
and will be required to schedule a new billable appointment for continued service. The ONLY exception to 
this is either Helpdesk or the Field Engineer approving a Revisit, which they will then inform us to set up a 
Revisit. 
 
- Dispatchers are required to inform the client that our Field Engineers will be providing a 4-Point 
inspection during the visit and that it provides a 2-week warranty period with us. 
 
 
An example of how I like to inform clients of the 4-Point inspection, “Once the Engineer has 
resolved your computer’s difficulties, they will perform a quick 4-Point inspection on your system to 
ensure all the other components are still looking healthy. It also provides a 2-week warranty period with

Chunk 113:
ensure all the other components are still looking healthy. It also provides a 2-week warranty period with 
us, so if your system experiences any issues related to the visit, we’ll send our Engineer back out for a 
complimentary service equal to the time they were on-site previously.” 
 
- Typically, clients do not ask for more details on what the 4-Point inspection entails, but if they ask, the 
Four-Point Inspection consists of:  
 
#1. Backup: 1, 2 ,3 Backup! Starting with 1 being the existing source of the data. Moving on to 2, the 
on-site back-up. Lastly 3, their Cloud back-up solution. Having an external backup is one step in the 
overall backup process; however, ALL clients SHOULD have a cloud-based solution. There are free 
alternatives and paid subscription suites. Whether a drive fails or catastrophe strikes, the data will remain 
available in the cloud, safe. 
 
#2. SMART Check - Hard drive: This is a built-in tool for a hard drive or SSD to monitor its own vital

Chunk 114:
available in the cloud, safe. 
 
#2. SMART Check - Hard drive: This is a built-in tool for a hard drive or SSD to monitor its own vital 
values. This can give a very good idea of the overall health of the drive and therefore allow us to predict 
and avoid total failure of the drive. This gives us an opportunity to back up data before it's lost completely. 
This is extremely important for SSDs due to the difficulty of recovering data once they’ve failed. 
 - SMART is Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology, it is a built-in self-test that can be used 
to indicate when an HDD is beginning to fail. It can be used on traditional hard drives, solid-state drives, 
and eMMC drives. HDD failures happen in two categories: predictable: slow degradation of chips or 
writing surface or unpredictable like physical trauma or electrical shock. According to one statistic, 60% of 
hard drive failure is caused by unpredictable failure, which includes heat and low voltage. The technology

Chunk 115:
hard drive failure is caused by unpredictable failure, which includes heat and low voltage. The technology 
was first introduced in 1992 and while the information it provides is very good, taking the test at face value 
and waiting for it to say bad, is a sure way to lose data. The test will only tell you to drive ok or drive 
failure. This test will likely say it is ok, even if the drive is failing. 
 
#3. Anti-Virus Solution: Having a good antivirus is not an option these days, it is mandatory. Antivirus is 
required on every single computer and the simple “they don’t use it for anything will not suffice. At the end 
of the day, the internet can be a breeding ground for new viruses and scam messages. Given our client 
demographic it is necessary that we explain our process to our clients but more importantly walk them 
Table of Contents

Chunk 116:
through what AV is necessary or suited for their needs. There are threats both obvious and hidden that 
cause absolute havoc on people’s machines and in turn point the finger at us that we did not better 
prepare them for what happened to their system. Viruses and malware are common but more importantly, 
a good antivirus will prevent scam pop-ups and phishing instances which can lead to massive financial 
loss from a scammer who may gain access to banking credentials, etc. 
 
#4. Network Check: Inspecting the network quality and signal to ensure they are getting the most out of 
their internet connection. Most people don’t understand how internet speeds will affect their overall 
network speed. Checking this can rule out some speed concerns for the End User. If they’re only getting 
10 Mbps and they have 4 people trying to stream at the same time, it can lead to some misleading 
behavior. Checking this also allows an End User to know if they’re getting the speed they're paying for

Chunk 117:
behavior. Checking this also allows an End User to know if they’re getting the speed they're paying for 
versus having issues with their hardware. 
 
Ensuring your customers are informed about this inspection will leave no room for surprises when the 
engineer arrives on-site and requests to take a look at these big four items and increases the likelihood of 
a more fulfilling service starting at our hourly rate of $125 per hour.

Devices We Do and Do Not Work On 
 
As Dispatchers, it is not our job to diagnose and determine what steps are needed to resolve a 
client’s computer issues. Our job is to gather information about a client’s situation and schedule 
the appointments for our Field Engineers to handle.  
 
The reasoning as to why we don’t diagnose a problem over the phone is because we cannot 
rely on an EU’s provided information alone since most of our clients do not have any idea what 
they’re talking about. If we attempted to try and help a client over the phone, there is a strong 
chance that it could make their computer’s issues even worse, which could cause potential 
liability issues. We have to get a Field Engineer on-site to diagnose the issue properly so we 
can provide clients high quality computer repair service. 
 
In terms of part replacement, repair, upgrades, we let the customer know the engineer would

In terms of part replacement, repair, upgrades, we let the customer know the engineer would 
need to get on-site to clarify exactly what they would need and help them order it. There are 
things such as pin counts, type of display (matte, glossy), screen resolution, revisions, and 
refresh rates these days that we won't be able to ensure from our dispatcher standpoint.

General Estimates for Repairs 
 
- Typical service visits range anywhere between 1.5-2.5 hours of time on-site. ($125 - 
$250) 
 
 
- However, it ultimately depends on what the FE determines once they’ve had a chance 
to review the client’s system. 
 
If hardware replacements are needed to resolve a client’s issues, the FE will generally be able 
to determine that within the 1st hour of service and help source out those parts for the client to 
order. Then we’d set up a follow-up for any installation required, which would be standard 1-2 
hour TOS average. 
 
 
- Hardware needed? Two Visits. 1st visit to source out replacement parts (Likely 1st 
hour), 2nd visit to install (1-2 hours)

Chunk 132:
Remote Visits 
 
Remote visits are where one of our Field Engineers will remote into a client’s computer and resolve their 
system’s issues over the phone. The FE is on the phone with the client the entire service visit and collects 
payment over the phone once the service is completed. 
 
Remote Service Visits are charged at the same $125 hourly rate, but do not include a $4 fuel 
surcharge. 
 
Things to consider/confirm with the client prior to scheduling a remote service: 
 
- Is the system able to turn on and stay powered on? 
 
- Is the EU able to interact with the system? 
 
- Is the system able to connect to the internet? 
 
 
If a client is able to connect to the internet on their device, but their system randomly shuts off on them 
after a few minutes of use, we would likely want to schedule that as an on-site visit since the FE may 
need to check out hardware issues prior to diagnosing software issues.

- Cancellations: EU can choose to cancel by either emailing us directly or calling us. 
Cancellation will be processed by Corey Northfield typically when notice is received. Please do 
NOT cancel any Square invoices for N-Able. Only either Corey Northfield will cancel the invoice 
as it must be properly recorded in multiple systems.  
 
- Paying Invoice: Renewals must be paid for within Square. Payment can be accepted via the 
invoice link sent to their email address or over the phone with a dispatcher that has Square 
access. If you do not have Square access, you can transfer the call to someone who does or if 
no one is available, contact Corey Northfield (weekdays).

payment for the initial year. The FE will obtain information needed for renewal and will forward it 
on to the N-Able team (Corey Northfield) at Karls.

getting the invoice, take down the new email address and send it via DM to Corey Northfield. 
Inform the EU that the email will be updated for the future.

Carbonite is the Cloud Data Backup solution that we recommend to clients to backup and preserve their

Tawk.To 
 
 
- Tawk.To is our live-chat program offered on every website we have for clients to quickly ask a 
question. 
 
 
- The main goal of Tawk.To is for us to get the client on the phone as quickly as possible. We 
are NOT aiming to answer all of a client’s questions or schedule an appointment over live-chat.  
This is an example of how 9/10 of Tawk.To conversations should look. The client will ask if their issue is 
something we can assist with, we respond with yes and ask for a phone number to discuss. 
 
 
“We can certainly send an engineer out to assist with your PC's current difficulties. Is 
there a phone number I could give you a quick call at to discuss options?” 
 
There are times when clients will ask how much we charge. We want to avoid providing that information 
over live-chat because a client can simply take the info and leave without further communication. We 
have a much more probable chance to book a client if they’re on the phone.

Chunk 145:
“Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine an accurate price quote without gathering 
additional details about your system’s difficulties. Is there a phone number I could give you a 
quick call at to discuss further?” 
 
Typically, the EU will then provide a good contact number for us to call. If they persist in getting a quote 
over the chat or say they are unable to use their phone currently, then you can let them know how we 
charge. 
 
 
“We charge for the time that our Field Engineer spends on-site with you at an hourly rate 
of $125.00 per hour, prorated after the first hour. Typical visits last between 1-2 hours, but it 
ultimately depends on what your system’s issue is. If you’d like to setup an appointment, please 
submit an appointment request on our website.” 
 
Most often, though, clients will provide their phone number and we would then call them with the phone 
number associated with the website they’re using for the live chat.

Data Recovery 
 
- Our Field Engineers carry the tools and software necessary to recover data from a standard 
HDD or SSD. Generally, we don’t need a computer to be operational in order to recover the data as 
oftentimes we can pull the HDD and recover from there. 
 
 
- SD Cards, USB Thumb Drives, or other data storage devices will require the FE on-site to 
determine any specific adapters or other equipment that may be required to attempt recovery. 
 
 
- We CANNOT PROVIDE ANY GUARANTEES OF RECOVERY. We do not know the current

Chunk 147:
determine any specific adapters or other equipment that may be required to attempt recovery. 
 
 
- We CANNOT PROVIDE ANY GUARANTEES OF RECOVERY. We do not know the current 
state that a client’s drive is in, so we have to send an Engineer out to determine what is recoverable 
on-site. 
 
 
- If Data is not recoverable on-site, we do have options for Clean Room Data Recovery. 
 
Clean Room Data Recovery 
 
 
- When a Field Engineer is unable to recover a client’s information on-site, we do have alternative 
options to further attempt recovery of that client’s data that we offer, such as a clean room recovery. 
 
 
- A clean room recovery consists of the Field Engineer taking the client’s drive off-site and 
shipping it to our clean room in Phoenix, Arizona to attempt more advanced methods of recovery. 
 
 
- A Clean Room recovery requires the client to pay a $250 initial deposit, on-top of normal

Chunk 148:
shipping it to our clean room in Phoenix, Arizona to attempt more advanced methods of recovery. 
 
 
- A Clean Room recovery requires the client to pay a $250 initial deposit, on-top of normal 
TOS, to cover shipping costs and goes towards any additional fees the recovery may incur. This 
initial deposit is charged on-top of the TOS the Field Engineer has already accrued. 
Table of Contents

Chunk 149:
- Typically, clean room recoveries average anywhere between $1,000 - $2,000  
 
Currently, @Sam (Dispatch Team Lead) handles Clean Room Data Recovery Clients and should have 
any of their information forwarded to him in Slack DM.

Trip Fees 
 
- When a client is located outside the normal service visit range, we can still send the Field Engineer 
out to help the client for an additional $45 trip fee on-top of TOS and $4 fuel surcharge. 
 
- To determine whether a client's address/zip requires a trip fee, refer to the Zip Code Service Range 
section and check if the client’s ZIP is included in the serviceable range.

Find Function (Cntrl - F/Command - F) is your friend to quickly find zip codes.   
 
Example: If you’re looking for the zip code 78201, search the first four digits (7820) as some zips are 
listed in sections, ie  78201-61  
 
 
If the ZIP is NOT included, you can assume a trip fee is required. (Ping a Dispatch Manager for 
confirmation if you’re unsure)

Handling Customer Concerns 
 
Clients will call in regarding a previous visit and may not be satisfied with the level of service they 
received. Here is the process we should take when we receive these calls. 
 
- If the client is calling in about their system “still doing the same thing it was before the 
FE came out.” 
 
 
Check if the client received a full 4-Point inspection during their original service visit by navigating 
to the Work Order URL and scanning the FE’s notes. If the client had a full 4-Point inspection and is 
contacting us within 2 weeks of the service visit date, and the issue clearly related to the work 
performed, we immediately offer to set up a Revisit appointment for the client to send the FE back 
out for a complimentary visit (up to the TOS the FE had on previous visit). 
 
 
If the client did NOT receive a full 4-Point inspection, they do NOT immediately qualify for

out for a complimentary visit (up to the TOS the FE had on previous visit). 
 
 
If the client did NOT receive a full 4-Point inspection, they do NOT immediately qualify for 
revisit, so we offer to set up a new billable service for them to send an FE back out asap. Clients 
may not approve of that option, so then we would inform the client that we will forward their inquiry to the 
FE and have the FE contact the EU at their earliest availability to discuss the situation. Refer to How to 
properly inform an FE to call a client for this procedure. 
 
 
From there, the FE will contact the EU and let Dispatch know if we can set up a Revisit 
appointment for this client.  
 
 
 
 
 
- If the client is calling in requesting any type of financial reimbursement, refund, 
reduction, etc 
 
- First, offer to set up a Revisit if the EU qualifies. 
 
 
- If the EU declines the Revisit or does not qualify for a revisit.  Advise EU you will gather their

reduction, etc 
 
- First, offer to set up a Revisit if the EU qualifies. 
 
 
- If the EU declines the Revisit or does not qualify for a revisit.  Advise EU you will gather their 
information and notify management of their request.  Dispatchers do not have the clearance to issue any 
type of refunds to clients and your response should be similar to this: 
 
“Unfortunately, I’m just a dispatcher so I’m unable to approve any type of refund for previous 
services. I will forward your request to Management and they will reach out to you by e-mail once 
they’ve had a chance to review the situation.” 
 
Developing a Customer Concern Ticket 
 
To properly submit a Customer concern to Helpdesk for review, follow these steps: 
*PRIOR TO CREATING A CUSTOMER CONCERN, CHECK IF THE CLIENT ALREADY HAS 
AN EXISTING CONCERN TICKET OPEN BY SEARCHING THEIR NAME IN FRESHDESK*

2. Fill out the client's information into the required boxes. 
The e-mail address must remain as "Customer Concern" <nathanheaddy@karlstechnology.com [URL: mailto:nathanheaddy@karlstechnology.com]> 
 
- Enter EU’s first and last name
- Enter EU’s Phone Numbers 
 
- The subject line will be used so dispatch or helpdesk can easily find customer concerns inside of 
Freshdesk by seeing the term “Customer Concern” when searching for a customer’s name. Please

Chunk 197:
Customer’s E-mail Address: EU@email.com 
 
"Information regarding the customer's concern: Client is stating that the FE over-charged them for 
the amount of time that they were on-site. EU was informed that management would review the 
situation and reach back out with a resolution once they've reviewed the case.

3. Once the information is filled out, you will click the 'Create' button at the bottom-right of the screen 
to generate the ticket. 
 
4. Once the ticket is created, you will go to execute scenarios and select ‘Finish Customer 
Concern’. Doing this will ping Helpdesk in their own channel that a ticket was generated for them to 
review. 
 
5. Finally, copy the link for the ticket you've just created and paste it in the WO as a private note

5. Finally, copy the link for the ticket you've just created and paste it in the WO as a private note 
and include your name. This will ensure that if the EU calls in later to a different dispatcher. That 
dispatcher can view the most recent WO and see there is a Customer Concern Ticket 
 
Customer Concern - https://karlstechnology.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/###### - name 
 
 
Dispatch will also be able to search the client's name in Freshdesk and the search should 
show the Complaint ticket. 
 
 
 
Helpdesk will now review the EU’s situation and determine if any reimbursement is in order.

General Questions 
 
Do the Field Engineers carry replacement hardware with them? 
 
 
- No. We must send an Engineer out to source out compatible hardware replacements for a 
system prior to any installation. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Can a client source out their own hardware replacement and then have us out to install 
it? 
 
 
- Yes. If a client feels comfortable enough sourcing out the replacement hardware themselves and 
only wants us out to install it, we can do that. 
 
- However, we cannot guarantee the compatibility if the EU sources out their own hardware. We

only wants us out to install it, we can do that. 
 
- However, we cannot guarantee the compatibility if the EU sources out their own hardware. We 
would still charge for the Engineer’s TOS in the event that the replacement part is not correct.

This client with a follow-up appointment has been rescheduled multiple times due to the 
same FE calling out, can I schedule them with a different FE? 
 
 
- Dispatchers are required to get confirmation from Helpdesk or a Manager prior to scheduling a 
follow-up appointment with any other FEs besides the original FE who ran the initial visit.

What certifications do our Field Engineers’ have?

Can we unlock Bitlocker? 
 
 
- Unless the EU has the BitLocker code or access to the Microsoft account it's associated with, 
there’s not much we can do besides factory reset the system. We can still send an Engineer out to assist 
them with setting them up to avoid this situation in the future.

Do Same-day bookings receive a same-day cancellation fee? 
 
Table of Contents

Chunk 208:
-Yes. New clients receive an SDC fee if they cancel the same-day as their appointment, even if 
they booked it the same-day. 
 
 
- We need to be sure we properly inform clients that do schedule a same-day appointment about 
our cancellation policy. This is an example of how I like to inform clients, “Typically, we require 24 hours 
notice of any need to cancel or reschedule to avoid a cancellation fee. Since this is a same-day 
booking, you are waiving that option and if you cancel the appointment, there would be a fee 
associated with that. However, if you do need to cancel the appointment, if you reschedule the 
appointment, any cancellation fee is waived.”

This client had 3 of the 4 points run during the 4-Point inspection, but waived the 4th. 
Can I still schedule a Revisit for this client? 
 
 
- No. We cannot set up a complimentary Revisit for this client as they do not qualify. A Full 
4-Point inspection is required for warranty, so we can only offer to set up a new billable service visit. If the 
client has an issue with that, we can contact the FE who ran the previous visit to discuss with the EU to 
determine if they approve setting up the Revisit.
