Before using write_to_file always make a .old version of the file first.  

Process to follow to resolve write_to_file file truncation issues with documents that are more than 500 lines: 
1. You need to break the document in to 4 seperate files, each with a maximum of 500 lines of code.
2. Make your edits to each of these file chunks
3. Once edits are complete, merge the edited chunks together.

After using write_to_file always compare the two and use the data to fix early file truncations
