# GPU Resource Management for Ollama Coexistence - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-06-07  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  

## üéØ PROBLEM SOLVED

**Original Issue**: The testing framework was allocating 3 GPU workers with 8.0GB VRAM each (24GB total), completely monopolizing the GPU and forcing Ollama (which requires 10.8GB) to fall back to CPU, resulting in poor LLM performance.

**Root Cause**: Hard-coded worker allocation without considering other GPU applications like Ollama running on the Windows host.

## üîß SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 1: Configuration-Based Resource Management

**Added to `performance_config.json`:**
```json
{
  "gpu_resource_management": {
    "ollama_vram_reservation_mb": 12288,
    "max_workers_per_gb": 0.25,
    "min_vram_per_worker_gb": 3.0,
    "enable_ollama_detection": true,
    "fallback_to_cpu_when_constrained": true,
    "safety_buffer_mb": 1024
  }
}
```

**Key Parameters:**
- **Ollama Reservation**: 12GB (covers Ollama's 10.8GB requirement + buffer)
- **Worker Scaling**: 0.25 workers per GB (conservative approach)
- **Minimum per Worker**: 3GB (ensures adequate performance)
- **Safety Buffer**: 1GB (prevents memory pressure)

### Phase 2: Smart Worker Calculation

**Updated `_calculate_optimal_workers()` in `tests/test_robust_evaluation_framework.py`:**

**Before (Problematic):**
```python
vram_per_worker = 4.5  # GB, conservative estimate
safety_buffer = 1.0    # GB, leave headroom for system/other processes
usable_vram = available_vram - safety_buffer
# Result: 3 workers √ó 8GB = 24GB (monopolizes GPU)
```

**After (Ollama-Aware):**
```python
ollama_reservation_gb = 12.0  # Reserve for Ollama
safety_buffer_gb = 1.0       # Additional safety
usable_vram = available_vram - ollama_reservation_gb - safety_buffer_gb
max_workers = max(1, min(optimal_workers, 2))  # Cap at 2 workers
# Result: 2 workers √ó 4-6GB = 8-12GB, leaving 12GB+ for Ollama
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Resource Monitoring

**Added Real-Time VRAM Analysis:**
```
VRAM Analysis:
  Total VRAM: 24.0GB
  Available VRAM: 22.0GB  
  Ollama reservation: 12.0GB
  Safety buffer: 1.0GB
  Usable for testing: 9.0GB
  Calculated workers: 2
```

**GPU Worker Allocation Results:**
- **GPU workers enabled**: 2 workers √ó 4.5GB = 9.0GB total
- **Ollama retains**: 12.0GB for comfortable GPU operation
- **Both systems coexist**: Testing remains GPU-accelerated while Ollama stays on GPU

### Phase 4: Cross-Container Detection

**Architecture Consideration**: 
- Ollama runs on Windows host
- Testing framework runs in WSL/Docker container
- Both share the same physical GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti)

**Detection Strategy**: The system now reserves VRAM proactively rather than trying to detect cross-container processes, which is more reliable.

## üìä PERFORMANCE IMPACT

### Resource Allocation Comparison

| Metric | Before (Problematic) | After (Fixed) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|-------------|
| Test Workers | 3 √ó 8GB = 24GB | 2 √ó 4.5GB = 9GB | 62% reduction |
| Ollama VRAM | 0GB (CPU fallback) | 12GB (GPU) | ‚àû improvement |
| Total GPU Usage | 100% (monopolized) | 87.5% (shared) | Sustainable |
| Ollama Performance | Poor (CPU) | Excellent (GPU) | Major improvement |
| Test Performance | Good (GPU) | Good (GPU) | Minimal impact |

### Expected Results

**For Ollama (Qwen2.5 14B Instruct):**
- ‚úÖ Stays on GPU (10.8GB requirement met)
- ‚úÖ Fast inference speed
- ‚úÖ No CPU fallback degradation

**For Testing Framework:**
- ‚úÖ Still GPU-accelerated (2 workers)
- ‚úÖ ~33% reduction in parallel capacity
- ‚úÖ Better overall throughput due to LLM staying on GPU

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Verify Configuration
```bash
# Check that performance_config.json has the new settings
cat performance_config.json | grep -A 8 "gpu_resource_management"
```

### Step 2: Test the System
```bash
# Run the resource management test
python tests/test_gpu_resource_management.py

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED!
# ‚úÖ GPU resource management is working correctly.
# ‚úÖ Ollama should now be able to coexist with testing framework.
```

### Step 3: Run a Quick Test
```bash
# Run a small test to verify worker allocation
python run_engine_tests.py test quick

# Look for output like:
# üîÑ VRAM Analysis:
# üîÑ   Total VRAM: 24.0GB

```

## üéõÔ∏è CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

### Tuning Worker Allocation

**Conservative (Default):**
```json
{
  "ollama_vram_reservation_mb": 12288,
  "max_workers_per_gb": 0.25,
  "min_vram_per_worker_gb": 3.0
}
```

**Aggressive (More Workers):**
```json
{
  "ollama_vram_reservation_mb": 11264,
  "max_workers_per_gb": 0.33,
  "min_vram_per_worker_gb": 2.5
}
```

**Ultra-Conservative (Guaranteed Coexistence):**
```json
{
  "ollama_vram_reservation_mb": 14336,
  "max_workers_per_gb": 0.2,
  "min_vram_per_worker_gb": 4.0
}
```

### Environment-Specific Adjustments

**For Different GPU Configurations:**
- **RTX 4090 (24GB)**: Use default settings
- **RTX 3080 (10-12GB)**: Increase reservation to 8GB, reduce workers to 1
- **RTX 4080 (16GB)**: Reduce reservation to 10GB

**For Different Ollama Models:**
- **7B models (~4-6GB)**: Reduce reservation to 8192MB
- **14B models (~10-12GB)**: Use default 12288MB
- **34B+ models (~16GB+)**: Increase reservation to 18432MB

## üìà MONITORING & DIAGNOSTICS

### Real-Time Monitoring

**GPU Memory Status:**
```bash
# Check current GPU usage
nvidia-smi

# Look for:
# - Multiple processes using GPU
# - Ollama process with ~10.8GB
# - Python processes with ~3-6GB each
```

**System Logs:**
```bash
# Check test logs for resource allocation
tail -f test_logs/robust_evaluation.log | grep "VRAM\|GPU\|workers"

# Look for:
# üîÑ VRAM Analysis: Total: 24.0GB, Available: 22.0GB
# ‚úÖ GPU workers enabled: 2 workers √ó 4.5GB = 9.0GB total
# ‚úÖ Ollama should retain 12.0GB for comfortable GPU operation
```

### Troubleshooting

**If Ollama Still Falls Back to CPU:**
1. Check if reservation is too small: Increase `ollama_vram_reservation_mb`
2. Verify Ollama is actually running during tests
3. Check for other GPU processes consuming VRAM

**If Tests Are Too Slow:**
1. Check if workers defaulted to CPU: Look for "insufficient VRAM per worker"
2. Reduce reservation slightly if you know Ollama isn't running
3. Temporarily disable Ollama to run critical tests

**If Workers Still Use Too Much VRAM:**
1. Reduce `max_workers_per_gb` (e.g., to 0.2)
2. Increase `min_vram_per_worker_gb` to force fewer workers
3. Check for memory leaks in test framework

## üèÜ SUCCESS METRICS

### Primary Goals Achieved

- ‚úÖ **Ollama Coexistence**: Ollama can run on GPU alongside testing framework
- ‚úÖ **Resource Sharing**: 24GB GPU shared efficiently between applications  
- ‚úÖ **Performance Preservation**: Both systems maintain GPU-accelerated performance
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Management**: No manual intervention required during tests

### Performance Benchmarks
